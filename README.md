# Nautilus | Contracts

A library for secure smart contract development. Build on a solid foundation of community-vetted code similar to OpenZeppelin but for the AVM and using algorand python instead of solidity.

* Implementations of standards like ARC200 and ARC72.
* Flexible role-based permissioning scheme.
* Reusable Algorand python components to build custom contracts and complex decentralized systems.
